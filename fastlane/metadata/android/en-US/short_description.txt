This tuner is simple and intuitive. It is designed to get most functionality out of minimum effort.

What I learned from the newer Tuner Apps available on the market is, they should be intuitive.

Instead of just doing fft, this tuner uses the yin implementation from tarsos dsp, thanx to you guys over at belgium ! Really every user of this app should buy you a big mug of coffee :-)))

Additionally, you can choose one of four available pitch tracking algorithms.

greetings, and don't forget to play your guitar.
